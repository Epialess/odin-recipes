    <img src="./smashPot.jpg" alt="potatoes">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are little potato morsels, twice-cooked and infused with flavor!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds small yellow-fleshed potatoes</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried sage</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground thyme</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried savory</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a saucepan, fill with water to cover the potatoes, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the potatoes until tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow potatoes to cool.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are cooking, combine olive oil, butter, balsamic vinegar, garlic, rosemary, sage, thyme, savory, sea salt and pepper in a bowl. Stir with a fork to combine well.</li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, and lightly press down on the potatoes to partially crush them. Spoon the oil-herb mixture over each potato.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges of the potatoes are beginning to crisp, about 25 minutes. Cool for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
